      <h2 class="font-sans text-4xl/[1] mb-10">The story of Mike Lovin’ Punch began as a nameless, homemade alcoholic creation crafted purely for “vibes.”</h2>
      <p class="text-xl/[1] mb-4">Initially, a simple mix of orange juice and rum was the go-to, until one classic London day—a mix of grey clouds and sudden bursts of sun—inspired a desire for something more flavorful. What starteda one-off creation became an annual staple for the Notting Hill Carnival, eagerly anticipated by friends and family alike.</p>
      <p class="text-xl/[1]">Over time, the recipe was refined with thoughtful enhancements and a shift toward natural purity, evolving into a versatile, non-alcoholic punch that could be enjoyed as-is or customised with alcohol for those who preferred it. Mike Lovin’ Punch now serves as a lively, family-friendly alternative to alcoholic drinks, with the versatility to cater to both drinkers and non-drinkers.</p>
